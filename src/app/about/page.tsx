            I like finding smart ways to blend engineering and design to solve real problemsâ€”whether it is helping individuals work faster or helping teams build better systems. I am always looking for newer, simpler ways to do old things, especially when it means saving time, cutting friction, or unlocking something better.

I care a lot about open source and automation.

          I have designed and built products, systems, teams, and processes that help people solve real problems efficiently, creatively, and at scale. From simplifying onboarding to refining sales flows, I focus on user experience at every touchpoint: what people see, feel, and remember. Then I find ways to automate the boring stuff so teams can focus on what really matters.

          Currently, I serve as the <strong>Associate Director of Engineering</strong> at <a href="https://350.org" target="_blank">350.org</a> - a global climate movement leveraging technology to drive meaningful action. I lead a distributed team of engineers, building infrastructure and platforms that scale our mission: solving the climate crisis by empowering people worldwide.

          Beyond my professional role, I am deeply involved in the open-source community. As a volunteer with <a href="https://oscafrica.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Community Africa (OSCA) </a>, I contribute to fostering a vibrant ecosystem of open-source contributors across the continent. I am part of the organizing team for the annual <a href="https://festival.oscafrica.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Festival - <strong>OSCAFEST</strong></a> - a high-profile event that brings together developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts to share knowledge, collaborate, and promote open-source tools and practices. I also contribute to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> because great documentation helps great developers become even better, and because sharing knowledge is just as important as writing code.
          </p>

          <p>
          On the side, I also try to find time to build interesting tools that I release as open source software.

          <p>Previously, I have worked in various organizations, sometimes in leadership positions:</p>

          I am passionate about technology, automation, and building tools that help people do more with less. Lately, I have been experimenting with creatively adding AI to the mix.

            I am a realist with a leaning towards optimism. I am a big believer
            in Midwestern work ethic. I choose books over movies 9 times out of
            10 and try to find time to write and blog about productivity hacks,
            automation, and business.
